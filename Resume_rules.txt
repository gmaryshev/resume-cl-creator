- Resume should try to be ATS friendly
- Do not blatantly lie e.g. do not say that my project used technologies that 
  I didn't actually use
- Double check the documents to make sure that the text is all 
  correct and sounds natural e.g. don't randomly name a section "Access Projects" 
  instead of "Projects", "Access Projects" sounds unnatural
