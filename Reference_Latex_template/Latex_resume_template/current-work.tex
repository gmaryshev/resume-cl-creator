\begin{itemize}[left=0pt, itemsep=0pt]
    % \item \textbf{Programming:} \textbf{C}, \textbf{C++}, \textbf{Java}, \textbf{Python}, Haskell, R, Racket, Rust, SML. AVR assembly.
    % % \item \textbf{Databases:} Database creation and management in \textbf{SQL} (MySQL).
    % % \item \textbf{Data science \& ML:} Familiar with common data science and \textbf{ML} workflows (in Python, R).
    % \item \textbf{Operating systems:} Comfortable working in \textbf{UNIX}-based operating systems \textbf{(macOS, Linux)} and \textbf{Windows}. Familiarity with operating systems concepts, such as virtualization and concurrency.
    % \item \textbf{Computer networks:} Familiarity with computer networking fundamentals (\textbf{HTTP}, \textbf{DNS}, the socket abstraction, \textbf{TCP} and \textbf{UDP}, and further down the network stack). Exposure to networking tools (e.g. \textbf{Wireshark}).
    % \item \textbf{Version control:} \textbf{Git}, GitHub.
    % \item \textbf{Developer tools:} Code sanitizers such as ASan, UBSan; lcov; Catch2; debugging software via GUI debuggers.
    % \item \textbf{Miscellaneous:} Exposure to \textbf{machine learning} (ML) and database systems (\textbf{SQL}, MySQL).
    \item \textbf{Personal website:} Learning the tools required to create a simple static site that will serve as a \href{http://johnsmith.github.io/}{personal blog}.
    \item \textbf{C++:} Deepening knowledge of \textbf{C++} via rigorous \href{https://example.edu/course/CS350}{\textit{Advanced Programming Techniques for Robust and Efficient Computing}}, to cover such topics as: compile-time vs run-time computation (templates, constexpr), exception safety and RAII, smart pointers and move semantics, multithreading and thread safety. (And much more!)
    \item \textbf{Compilers:} Studying compiler construction in a \href{https://example.edu/course/CS440}{project-based course}. By the end of the term, we will have implemented a \textbf{C-like} programming language called Seelish, using ANTLR4 to assist with the implementation of the compiler front-end, and targeting \textbf{Java Virtual Machine (JVM) bytecode}.
