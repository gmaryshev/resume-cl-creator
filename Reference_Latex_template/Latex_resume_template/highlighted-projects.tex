% {Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, numpy}
% {Apr. 2024}
% {In a team of four, we leveraged the datasets provided by \href{https://moneypuck.com/}{MoneyPuck} to assess shot quality using \textbf{logistic regression}, and trained a \textbf{long short-term memory model} for the dynamic estimation of game outcome odds. Both models were demonstrated to outperform dummy classifiers.}

% {Mar. 2024}
% {Implemented an interpreter for a simple programming language, MUPL, in Racket. The interpreter is written in a \say{purely functional} style. MUPL features lexical scope, functions,  closures, and various other, simpler expressions.}

% \projectEntry{Basic image order rendering pipeline (ray-tracer)}{C++, Eigen}{May 2023 - Jul. 2023}{
% Capable of drawing various rendering primitives, the ray-tracer uses the Phong lighting model to approximate various lighting phenomena: reflections, refraction, and shadows. Implementation of a data structure for accelerating ray-primitive intersection queries yielded a frame-generation \textbf{speedup of around 200-500x.}}

% \begin{itemize}[left=0pt, itemsep=2pt]
%     \item Wrote a program that inspects the data model of a MySQL database \textit{without} accessing the databases metadata.
%     \item Verifies the data models correct implementation by way of thoughtfully constructed queries.
%     \item Verifies (1) whether a list of attributes is a superkey for a given table, (2) whether a set of attributes of a table is configured as a foreign key referencing some attributes of another table, (3) that a particular referential integrity policy is enforced, and (4) whether some functional dependency is enforced.

    {Interactive SPH-Based Fluid Simulation}
    {C++, legacy OpenGL, glm (OpenGL mathematics), Tcl/Tk}
    {Nov. 2024 - Dec. 2024}
    {Completed as a part of the requirements for a \href{https://example.edu/course/CS360}{course on computer animation}, provided an implementation of SPH-based fluid simulation in keeping with details suggested by a seminal research paper on the topic, also integrating results from other works.
    %OpenMP directives were used to parallelize (and speedup) the simulation loop, with some success. Adjustability of the simulation volume is provided to the user via a Tcl/Tl GUI.
