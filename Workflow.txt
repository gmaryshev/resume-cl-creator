RESUME & COVER LETTER GENERATION WORKFLOW

STEP 1: ANALYZE LATEX TEMPLATE STRUCTURE
- Review the LaTeX resume templates in Reference_Latex_template/ for styling inspiration
- Focus on document structure, formatting, and layout commands
- CRITICAL: DO NOT copy any personal information from templates (names, emails, phone numbers, etc.)

STEP 2: GATHER PERSONAL CONTENT
- Read files in Reference_resumes/ for my actual resume content
- Read files in Reference_info/ for additional personal information (if available)
- This is the source of truth for my experience, skills, education, and contact details

STEP 3: READ JOB DESCRIPTION
- Locate and read the job description file in Job_descriptions/
- Extract key requirements, skills, and qualifications to tailor the application

STEP 4: CREATE OUTPUT FOLDER
- Create a new folder in Output/ with naming convention:
  resume_cl_(Job_Title_at_Company)_(version_number)
  Example: resume_cl_Software_Engineer_at_Plexxis_1
- Increment version_number (1, 2, 3...) for each new generation

STEP 5: GENERATE DOCUMENTS
- Create tailored resume and cover letter based on job description
- Use LaTeX format matching the template style
- Resume should try to be ATS friendly
- Do not blatantly lie e.g. do not say that my project used technologies that I didnt actually use
- Compile to PDF format

STEP 6: ORGANIZE OUTPUT FILES
- Place compiled PDFs (resume_1.pdf and cover_letter_1.pdf) in the main folder
- Create subfolder: resume_cl_(Job_Title_at_Company)_latex_(version_number)
- Store all LaTeX source files (.tex, .aux, etc.) in the latex subfolder
