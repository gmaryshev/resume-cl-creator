RESUME & COVER LETTER GENERATION WORKFLOW

STEP 1: ANALYZE LATEX TEMPLATE STRUCTURE
- Review the LaTeX resume templates in Reference_Latex_template/ for styling inspiration
- Focus on document structure, formatting, and layout commands
- CRITICAL: DO NOT copy any personal information from templates (names, emails, phone numbers, etc.)

STEP 2: GATHER PERSONAL CONTENT
- Read files in Reference_resumes/ for my actual resume content
- Read files in Reference_info/ for additional personal information (if available)
- This is the source of truth for my experience, skills, education, and contact details

STEP 3: READ JOB DESCRIPTION
- Locate and read the job description file in Job_descriptions/
- Extract key requirements, skills, and qualifications to tailor the application

STEP 4: CREATE OUTPUT FOLDER
- Create a new folder in Output/ with naming convention:
  (Job_Title_at_Company)_resume_cl_(llm_model)_(version_number)
  Example: Software_Engineer_at_Plexxis_resume_cl_Sonnet4.5_1
- Increment version_number (1, 2, 3...) for each new generation

STEP 5: GENERATE DOCUMENTS
- Create tailored resume and cover letter based on job description
- Use LaTeX format matching the template style
- Resume should try to be ATS friendly
- Do not blatantly lie e.g. do not say that my project used technologies that 
  I didn't actually use
- Double check the documents to make sure that the text is all 
  correct and sounds natural e.g. don't randomly name a section "Access Projects" 
  instead of "Projects", "Access Projects" sounds unnatural
- Compile to PDF format

STEP 5A: CREATE INTERVIEW TIPS FILE
- Create a tips_Job_Title_at_Company.md file in the same folder as the resume and cover letter pdfs
- Content should include:
    - Your opinion of the job and how well your skills match it
    - Tips to prepare for the job interview

STEP 6: ORGANIZE OUTPUT FILES
- Place compiled PDFs ((full_name)_resume_(Job_Title_at_Company)_(version_number)_(llm_model_initials).pdf and (full_name)_cover_letter_(Job_Title_at_Company)_(version_number)_(llm_model_initials).pdf) in the main folder
  - LLM model initials: H for Haiku, S for Sonnet, Gr for Grok, etc.
- Place the tips_Job_Title_at_Company.md file in the main folder alongside the PDFs
- Create subfolder: (Job_Title_at_Company)_resume_cl_latex_(version_number)
- Store all LaTeX source files (.tex, .aux, etc.) in the latex subfolder
